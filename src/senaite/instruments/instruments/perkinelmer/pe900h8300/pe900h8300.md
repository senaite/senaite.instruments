Perkin Elmer PinAAcle 900H and Optima 8300

The file can be XLS, XLSX, or CSV.

Three colum values are used, which must have the headers below.  Other columns are ignored

    - Sample ID
    - Analyte Name
    - Reported Conc (Calib)

The interim fields on the calculation will be completed as follows:

    - `reading`: Contains the value from the Analyte Name column for this sample

`Sample ID` and `Analyte Name` will be used to locate the destination analysis for each result. They will be transformed
before searching like this:

    - `Sample ID`: Only letters, numbers, dashes and underscores will remain.
    - `Analyte Name`: Only letters and numbers will remain.

If a cell value contains multiple lines of text, only the first line will be imported.

`Analyte name` does not need to contain an exact match to the AnalysisService keyword.

        - If `Analyte Name` column contains a value "Ag 107 (cps)" the AR must contain 
          one Analysis who's keyword starts with "Ag107cps".

        - If exactly one such analyses is not found, the record is skipped with a warning.
